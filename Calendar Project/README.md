# Crative Portion

<ul>Search By Date:</ul>
  <ul><ul>We added a function in which users can input a date, and their date will be presented, showing their events and all. The way we did this was by creating a new button that opens to a form of type "date", and then taking the filled out value and assigning our currentDay/Month/Year variables to and updating our calendar.  </ul></ul>
<ul>Repeat Event</ul>
  <ul><ul>We added to our "Add Events" functionality to allow users to add events that are REPEATING. The code for this is in calender.html, repeat.js, getevent.php, and addevent.php. We use 4 queries to handle the various request (to either repeat daily, weekly, or yearly). We set whichever value was chosen to "0" and then depending on whichever has a value of 0 we print out either daily (for a month), monthly (for within the year), or yearly.</ul></ul>

# Citing Code

You can find the websites we reference on our bib.txt page. The pages we used were to understand different processes such as

<ul>Printing the Calendar</ul>
<ul>Understanding Checkboxes -> For the creative portion</ul>
